# vanity-eth-js

This is just a really quick project that generates an ethereum wallet with backup passphrase that can be imported into different wallets like Metamask and Rainbow.

# Why would I want this?

Chances are you probably don't. This will help you generated an ethereum address that matches some criteria, eg., addresses that start with `0xdead`. It's a silly vanity thing.

However, what's slightly different about this generator from others is that others only give you a private key for the address generated. This also gives you the backup passphrase which can be used for HD (brain) wallets. And why would you want that? I don't know but it makes adding the wallet to Metamask or Rainbow pretty easy.

# Usage

It's pretty barebones and not user friendly. Edit the source file `src/main.js` and set the prefix or any other criteria you want. It can take upwards of 10 minutes or so to match a prefix like `0xdead`.

# Contributions

Any contributions are welcome in the form of a PR. Issues are likely to be ignored for this as it's such a small project and it has served its purpose for me. However, I am happy to make small changes if requested nicely ðŸ˜€
